For my first post, I will show you some journal ideas. My posts will always be of things you can do too (arts and crafts, etc) so if you would like to have a go at this yourself, all you will need is (at least) a piece of paper, a black pen & coloured pens or highlighters. You may also want to use a ruler. 
Here are some images of ones I did and some points to help you if you want to try it too.

Above is the first page; Ideas for 2021. You may notice that I wrote down the [link of the blog](https://bakingwithrosie495171084.wordpress.com/category/bullet-journal/) I used for inspiration on this page.

This second page was just a quick idea I came up with.

Fonts can be a clever way to add an extra detail to your journal. I use a specific font to my journal to add character.

My favourite things to add details to a journal are doodles. They are simple and effective but not only that, they are also fun to draw.

Colour draws attention to your journal and makes it look nicer. In my opinion, the best things to use to add colour to your journal are pastel highlighters and crayola colouring pens. 

Finally, I added an extra detail to my journal cover. I hadn't used this book of plain paper until now so it was pretty much untouched. I wrote 'journal' onto a piece of paper and then glued it on. Here is the result:

My next blog post will be of layout ideas for a journal. Stay tuned!
